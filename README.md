ABOUT: 
This application is intended to help minorities locate safe areas and locations while adventuring. 
It uses google maps which is familiar for most people.
Users can create an account, write reviews for specific locations, view reviews for specific locations and update their profiles to match their identities.


STRETCH GOALS: 
I intend to refactor this web application into a mobile app in the near future.
I also intend to add more functionality such as uploading photos, favoriting locations and following other users.
The longterm goal for this application is to turn it into a social app where users can keep up with their favorite creators who recommend safe spaces for minorities. 

SETUP:
This is a NextJS project using Google Maps API, Prisma, Clerk Auth, Vercel, Tailwinds and MUI.
You will need to install React Google Maps, Prisma, Clerk, Tailwinds, and MUI as dependencies.
Vercel is being used as deployment and Database that connects to Prisma.
Start off by running the server. You can use 'npm run dev' in the CLI.
Then go to http://localhost:3000
